Business Objective:
This project aims to improve the energy production efficiency of a combined-cycle 
power plant by developing a machine learning model to predict its output based on 
key environmental variables. By understanding the relationship between these 
variables and energy production, we can optimize plant operation and maximize 
power generation.

 Features:

o Temperature (°C)

o Exhaust Vacuum (cm Hg)

o Ambient Pressure (millibar)

o Relative Humidity (%)


 Target Variable:

o Energy Production (MW) - Net hourly electrical energy output
